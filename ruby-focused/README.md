## Guidelines

### What can we contribute?

* Writing or improving documentation and project guides
* Making setup easier
* Making a sample app trying to recreate reported issues
* Making a sample app demonstrating the project‚Äôs usage
* Fixing a bug
* Adding tests
* Design for a homepage
* Writing a blog post on your process on any of the above
* Helping other people do these things

### Keep in mind

* Check `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, or other contributor guidelines if available
* Do pair programming. Seriously, work together! You learn more.
* You don't need to fully understand a project in order to contribute to it
* Errors happen for everyone, regardless of experience level. The trick is learning how to read the errors and knowing what to search for.
* Maintainers are often busy people and might not respond quickly. Add a ‚ÄúHey, wondering if you got a chance to look at this?‚Äù if you don‚Äôt hear back in a few days.
* When submitting, consider adding a note of ‚Äúthis is my first open source contribution‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am new to this project‚Äù, which people are always excited to see
* add `/cc @mentorusername` in any issue or pull requests you'd like a second set of eyes

### Install Ruby

On command line, run: `curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable ‚Äîruby`

Test the install by running: `ruby --version`. It should be `2.2.0` or above. More about [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install).

### Learning Git/GitHub

Unless you are comfortable with the command line or another Git client, we recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
