* Raise hands if you expect to make your first open source contribution

      * Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
   * Everyone else, pick a project, and sit at that table
      * set up the project in your computer
      * pick an issue to work on (or ask which one to pick)
      * send a pull request
         * go over contribution guidelines
         * improve the documentation, even in a small way
         * if you have time, work on a feature or bug
      * add a link to this document with your contributions (new issues count!)
* Getting help:
   * [Join the chat](http://chat.hackerhours.org/) (`#workshop` channel)
      * feel free to make other channels specific to the project
   * We will have mentors at the tables
   * Talk to people!
* [Code of conduct](http://hackerhours.org/policies.html)
* Thanks
   * Mentors
   * thoughtbot (space, food, coffee)
* Take pictures, post to meetup page and/or tweet @hackerhours
* At 2:30 pm, standup. We present what we worked on, mention difficulties we found, and what went well (~30 secs each).
* We’ll do more of these workshops, and meanwhile, come to [Hacker Hours](www.meetup.com/hackerhours) and [Ruby Project Night](http://www.meetup.com/Ruby-Project-Night-NYC) meetups!

## Guidelines

### What can we contribute?

* Writing or improving documentation and project guides
* Making setup easier
* Making a sample app trying to recreate reported issues
* Making a sample app demonstrating the project’s usage
* Fixing a bug
* Adding tests
* Design for a homepage
* Writing a blog post on your process on any of the above
* Helping other people do these things

### Keep in mind

* Check `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, or other contributor guidelines if available
* Do pair programming. Seriously, work together! You learn more.
* You don't need to fully understand a project in order to contribute to it
* Errors happen for everyone, regardless of experience level. The trick is learning how to read the errors and knowing what to search for.
* Maintainers are often busy people and might not respond quickly. Add a “Hey, wondering if you got a chance to look at this?” if you don’t hear back in a few days.
* When submitting, consider adding a note of “this is my first open source contribution” or “I am new to this project”, which people are always excited to see
* add `/cc @mentorusername` in any issue or pull requests you'd like a second set of eyes

On command line, run:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable —ruby
```

Test the install by running: `ruby --version`. It should be `2.2.0` or above. More about [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install).

### Learning Git/GitHub

Unless you are comfortable with the command line or another Git client, we recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
